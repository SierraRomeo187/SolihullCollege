**Tutorial: Creating a Windows Forms Application for Number Conversion - Part 1**

**Introduction**:
In this tutorial series, we'll create a Windows Forms Application using C# that can perform various number conversions, including binary, hexadecimal, ASCII, octal, and custom base. This project will help you learn about WinForms, UI design, event-driven programming, and basic numeric conversions.

**Prerequisites**:
- Visual Studio or another C# IDE.
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with the Visual Studio IDE.

**Part 1: Setting Up the Project (15 minutes)**

*Step 1: Launch Visual Studio*
1. Launch Visual Studio (or your preferred C# IDE).

*Step 2: Create a New Project*
2. Click on "File" > "New" > "Project..." to create a new project.
3. In the "Create a new project" dialog, search for "Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)" template.
4. Choose the template and click "Next."

*Step 3: Configure Project Settings*
5. Enter a name for your project, such as "NumberConverterApp."
6. Choose a location for your project files.
7. Select a solution name or create a new one.
8. Ensure that the "Create directory for solution" option is checked.
9. Click "Create."

*Step 4: Designing the User Interface (UI)*
10. In the Solution Explorer, you'll see the Form1.cs file. Double-click it to open the form designer.
11. The form designer allows you to drag and drop UI elements onto the form. Add the following elements:
    - TextBox for input (textBoxInput).
    - TextBox for output (textBoxOutput).
    - Radio buttons for different conversions (radioButtonBinary, radioButtonHexadecimal, radioButtonASCII, radioButtonOctal).
    - A Button for performing the conversion (buttonConvert).
    
*Step 5: Configure UI Elements*
12. Select each UI element and go to the Properties window to set properties such as Name, Text, and Size.
    - For example, set the Name of the input TextBox to "textBoxInput" and the Text to "Input."
13. Arrange and resize the elements as needed to create an intuitive UI layout.

*Step 6: Run Your Application*
14. Save your changes and click the "Start" button (green arrow) to run your application.
15. Your form should appear with the designed UI elements.

*Step 7: Recap*
Congratulations! In Part 1, you've learned how to:
- Create a new Windows Forms Application project.
- Design a basic UI for the number converter application.
- Configure UI element properties.

In Part 2, we'll focus on event-driven programming and wiring up event handlers to make your UI elements functional.

Stay tuned for Part 2 to continue building your Number Converter App!
