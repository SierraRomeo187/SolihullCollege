**Tutorial: Creating a Windows Forms Application for Number Conversion - Part 5**

**Introduction**:
Welcome to the final part (Part 5) of the Number Converter App tutorial series. In this last part, we will add finishing touches to our application, including improving the user interface, adding comments for code clarity, and preparing it for distribution.

**Prerequisites**:
- Completion of Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this tutorial series.
- Visual Studio or another C# IDE.

**Part 5: Final Touches and Distribution (30 minutes)**

*Step 1: Improve User Interface (UI)*
1. Enhance the visual appeal of your application by adding labels, adjusting the layout, and using appropriate font styles. Arrange the controls neatly on the form.
2. Use labels to identify input and output fields, conversion types, and the output format selection dropdown.

*Step 2: Add Comments for Code Clarity*
3. Go through your code and add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of significant code sections, especially the event handlers.
4. Use meaningful variable and method names to make your code self-explanatory.

```csharp
// Example of adding comments to code
// This event handler handles the button click to perform conversions
private void buttonConvert_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Read the user input from the input TextBox
    string userInput = textBoxInput.Text;

    // Check which conversion type is selected
    if (radioButtonDenary.Checked)
    {
        // Handle Denary conversion
        if (int.TryParse(userInput, out int denaryValue))
        {
            // Convert the denary value to the selected output format
            string selectedFormat = comboBoxOutputFormat.SelectedItem.ToString();
            string convertedValue = ConvertToSelectedFormat(denaryValue, selectedFormat);
            
            textBoxOutput.Text = convertedValue;
        }
        else
        {
            MessageBox.Show("Invalid denary input. Please enter a valid number.");
        }
    }
    // ... (other conversion types)
}
```

*Step 3: Prepare for Distribution*
5. Consider creating an installer for your application if you plan to distribute it.
6. In Visual Studio, you can use the "Publish" feature to create an installer package or a standalone executable (exe) file. Go to `Project -> Publish`.

*Step 4: Test Your Application*
7. Test your application thoroughly to ensure that all conversions and user interface improvements work as expected.

*Step 5: Celebrate Your Accomplishment!*
8. Congratulations! You've successfully created a Windows Forms application for number conversion. You've learned various C# coding techniques, user interface design, error handling, and more.

*Step 6: Recap*
In Part 5, you've learned how to:
- Improve the user interface of your application for a better user experience.
- Add comments to your code for clarity and maintainability.
- Prepare your application for distribution by creating an installer or standalone executable.

You now have a fully functional Number Converter App that you can distribute, share, or use as a foundation for future projects. Keep exploring and building more exciting applications with C# and Windows Forms!

Thank you for following this tutorial series, and best of luck with your programming endeavours!
